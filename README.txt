CSC3022F ML Assignment 1: Clustering
====================================
Instructions:

"make install"
"make test"

These commands will install the necessary dependencies and run the clustering program to output a K-means.txt file.
====================================
As is, the code when run produces a scatter plot of the data before and after the algorithm is run as well. To disable this, comment out "derp.drawScatter()" on the last line.
====================================
Use "make clean" to clean the file of the virtual environment files as well as the output K-means file, which can be regenerated by rerunning the program.
